# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** C#, Unity engine
<p align="justify">
The game uses C# scripts to implement how objects and world interact with the player. Character and enemies were animated using sliced images and then connected with layers using Animator to match the correct status. The camera is always following the player, with smooth transitions between the world panels. Enemies have simple AI, which makes them follow player in their patrol range and move back to the starting position after losing sight of the player. The main character has a working health bar, coin counter and simple item menu. The player can interact with doors, coins, keys and destroy pots to find more items.
